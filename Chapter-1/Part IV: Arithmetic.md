Arithmetic

## Basic Arithmetic
Adding two ints x and y (given that they have already been initialised to a value):

```java
int z = x + y;
```

Subtracting two ints x and y:

```java
int z = x - y;
```

Dividing two ints x and y:

```java
int z = x / y;
```

Beware, as x and y are ints z is also an int, and if you remember, ints are whole numbers, so whatever z comes out to be will be rounded down to the nearest integer (i.e. whole number). For example, if `x` was 7, and `y` was 5, then `z` would be `1` when `x` is divided by `y`.

To avoid this problem you can use a double instead, so if `p` is a double equal to `7.0` and `q` is a double `5.0`, we could do the following:

```java
double p = 7;
double q = 5;
double r = p / q;
//r would be 1.4
```

If, however, `p` and `q` are integers, `r` will equal `1.0`, because the `/` operator works irresepective of anything other than `p` and `q`, and their datatypes.

To multiply two integers x and y:

```java
int z = x * y;
```

The symbols for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are `+`, `-`, `*` and `/` respectively.

#### Ex 1 (Physics)
Write a program to work out what the power in watts of a device is if the voltage is 10V and the current is 6A, and print the result.
Hint: Power (W) = Current * Voltage

#### Ex 2 (Physics)
Turn the last exercise into a method that accepts parameters for current and voltage, then returns power in watts.  Then write a program that uses the power method to calculate the energy transferred in kWh, when the current is 5A, the voltage is 14V over the space of 2 hours and print the result.
Hint: Energy transferred (kWh) = Power (kW) Ã— Time (h)


#### Ex 3 (Physics)
Write a program to work out the kinetic energy of an object with a mass of 500kg that has a velocity of 12 m/s, and print the result.
Hint: Kinetic Energy = 0.5 * Mass * (Velocity)^2

#### Ex 4 (Physics)
Write a program to answer the following physics question and print the result.  If a car has a mass of 800 kg and moves with a velocity of 25 m/s, what force is needed to stop the car in 50 metres?
Hint: You may want to turn the previous exercise into a method so you can easily work out the car's kinetic energy.  You will also need the equation Energy = Force * Distance.

#### Ex 5 (Maths)
Write a program to work out the missing angle of a triangle which has two known angles of 108 degrees and 24 degrees.
Hint: The angles of a triangle must sum up to 180 degrees.

#### Ex 6 (Ecology)
![A quadrat](https://github.com/HashanP/cadmus/raw/master/src/Images/Quadrants.png)

A standard quadrat used in school has an area of 0.25m<sup>2</sup>. A quadrat is used to sample a random area of a field to estimate the abundance/variety/percentage coverage of a species. For a random sampling to be statistically viable, at least 3% of the area must be sampled. Write a program, given the size of an area, (say 2000m<sup>2</sup>) works out the amount of different samplings that must be done.

## Advanced Arithmetic

### Powers
To get the value of a number to a given power you can use the `Math.pow()` function, which takes two parameters: a number and a power. To use this however, you must import the `java.lang.Math` package. A package is essentially a collection of functions. To import `java.lang.Math`, write this at the very top of your code:

```java
import java.lang.Math;
//Alternatively you could write the Math.pow() function in Java without importing java.lang.Math.
//An error will appear that will provide you with an option to import java.lang.Math() without you typing anything.
```

Then in your `main` method, you can write:

```java
int number = 2;
int power = 3;
System.out.println(Math.pow(number, power));
// Prints 8
```

### Square Roots
Another function in that package is the `Math.sqrt()` that returns the square root of a number.

```java
Sysem.out.println(Math.sqrt(25)); // Prints 5
```

### Remainders
To get the remainder of an int a when divided by another int b we can use `%` instead of `/` when dividing, so a%b, where a = 7 and b = 5...

```java
int n = 7 % 5;
// would result in n being 2.
```

#### Ex 7 (Geometry, Physics, Chemistry, Game Programming)
Write a programs that given four numbers *x<sub>1</sub>*, *y<sub>1</sub>*, *x<sub>2</sub>* and *y<sub>2</sub>*, that are points on a graph, and calculates the distance between them, using the formula:

This is very useful in collision dectection, in scientific models and game programming.
