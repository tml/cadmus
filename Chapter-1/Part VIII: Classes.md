Classes

## Creating Classes
I've already alluded to classes before. Ultimately, classes are the blueprints for objects. Objects are classes when instantiated. For instance let's say I have the code:

```java
public class Book {
  private String title;
  private String author;
  private String publisher;
 
  public Book(String bookTitle, String authorName, String publisherName) {
    title = bookTitle;
    author = authorName;
    publisher = publisherName;
  }
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Book firstBook = new Book("Horton Hears A Who!","Dr. Seuss","Random House");
  }
}
```

The first three statements within the class are variable declerations. They declare properties or attributes of the class. These are the variables that a `Book` is composed of. Note that a class does not necessarily have to be composed of primitives. A class can be composed of other classes such as `String` in the example. The keyword `private` means that you can only access it inside methods of that class, but not statics. For example, this in the `main` method would fail to compile:

```java
Book firstBook = new Book("Horton Hears A Who!","Dr. Seuss","Random House");
System.out.println(firstBook.title);
```

If I, however, make the property `public` then it will. The non-static method called `Book` of class `Book` is the **constructor**. You know it's the constructor because the method has the same name as the class. A constructor is the method called when you do:

```java
new Book("Horton Hears A Who!","Dr. Seuss","Random House");
```

Notice that the way in which you create an object is similar to how you create a variable, you have the type then the name of the object then the equals sign; the only difference comes after the equals sign.  Now, you have the word `new` which just tells the interpreter that the object that you are creating is a new object, and then you have what we call a *constructor method*. The characteristics of the object are passed as parameters.

#### Ex 1 
Rewrite the code into Java, and instantiate, that is to say create, your favourite book.

#### Ex 2
Change the code to create an array of books, and populate it with your favourite books.

## More non-static methods
Imagine beneath the constructor I added this method:

```java
public String getTitle() {
  return title;
}
```

This non-static method will be available on every instance, that is to say object, of `Book`, and returns a `String`. Now we have a way to get the book title. The advantage of this is that the title cannot be changed externally, but can be accessed.

#### Ex 3
Add a method to get the author and publisher of a `Book`.
