<p>Java&#39;s concept of classes and objects is nothing new. The original idea came from the need for computers to simulate real-world models. The first language to employ classes and objects was, in fact, called <em>Simula</em>. It was the first ever <strong>object-orientated language</strong> and included advanced features such as inheritance and virtual methods. It went on to influence <em>Smalltalk</em>, a language invented at Xerox PARC, which was also where the GUI was invented. Another language influence by Simula was the <em>Eiffel</em> programming language. Object-orientated programming boomed when object-orientated languages based on the <em>C</em> programming language were introduced. The supersets were <em>C++</em> by Bjarne Stroustrup and <em>Objective C</em> by Apple. </p>
<h2 id="java">Java</h2>
<p>Java was introduced far later, but had two advantages. Unlike other langauges, Java didn&#39;t have to be compiled seperately for Windows, Mac &amp; Linux. Instead a programmer could convert Java to Java bytecode, which could be run on any computer with the Java virtual machine. This advantage was so strong, that later languages such as <em>Scala</em> were built to compile straight down to Java bytecode. The second advantage was that you didn&#39;t have to delete variables once they had been used. In C, C++ and Objective C, you would have to manually erase a variable from memory once it had been used. If you hadn&#39;t erased all variables before the program ended, a <strong>memory leak</strong> would occur.</p>
<h2 id="inheritance">Inheritance</h2>
<p>We have already seen something called  <strong>inheritance</strong>. Inheritance is what happens with the <code>extends</code> keyword. Inheritance lets one class inherit all the methods of the other. That means that all methods and properties of the <strong>super class</strong> (the class being extended) will be accessible on the <strong>sub class</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="interfaces">Interfaces</h2>
<p>We have also seen <strong>interfaces</strong>. Interfaces are what happens with the <code>implements</code> keyword, and the <code>ActionListener</code> interface. A class implements an interface. An interface is a list of method definitions, which no method bodies. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-java">interface Bicycle {

    <span class="hljs-comment">//  wheel revolutions per minute</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> changeCadence(<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> newValue);

    <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> changeGear(<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> newValue);

    <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> speedUp(<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> increment);

    <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> applyBrakes(<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> decrement);
}
</code></pre>
<p>When you say a class implements an interface, it is saying it will implement the method definitions. Here&#39;s the code for an <code>ActionListener</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">interface</span> <span class="hljs-title">ActionListener</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">extends</span> <span class="hljs-title">EventListener</span> {</span>

    <span class="hljs-javadoc">/**
     * Invoked when an action occurs.
     */</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">actionPerformed</span>(ActionEvent e);

}
</code></pre>
<p>When you implement this interface, you must write out an <code>actionPerformed</code> method.</p>
